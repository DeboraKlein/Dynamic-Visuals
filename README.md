# Dynamic Visuals with Bookmarks & Toggle Buttons in Power BI & SWITCH + SELECTEDVALUE ‚Äì Creating Dynamic Measures in Power BI

Dynamic Visuals with Bookmarks & Toggle Buttons Use bookmarks and toggle buttons to switch between visuals, keeping dashboards intuitive and interactive for seamless data exploration.

SWITCH + SELECTEDVALUE ‚Äì Dynamic Measures Apply DAX logic to let users dynamically select metrics like Total Cost, Total Discount, and Quantity Bought, ensuring personalized insights.


 **Enhancing Data Exploration** 

Today, I learned a great way to offer users flexibility in data visualization:

-  **Using bookmarks** to toggle between a map and bar chart, giving users control over how they view their data.  
-  **Adding two buttons** to make the toggle seamless, almost like a simple on/off switch for visuals.

This approach keeps dashboards **clean, intuitive, and interactive**, making it easier to analyze trends **spatially or numerically**!

# SWITCH + SELECTEDVALUE ‚Äì Creating Dynamic Measures in Power BI

‚ö° **Customizing Metrics with User Selection** ‚ö°

A powerful technique I explored today: using **SWITCH + SELECTEDVALUE** to allow users to dynamically change the metric they want to analyze!

With this approach, users can swap between:  

‚úî **Total Cost**  
‚úî **Total Discount**  
‚úî **Quantity Bought**  

üîé Here‚Äôs a snippet of the **DAX logic**:

DAX
Option = SWITCH(
    SELECTEDVALUE(KPIs[New Values]),
    "Total Cost", [Total Cost],
    "Qty Bought", [Qty Buy],
    "Total Discount", [Discount]
)

Title = SELECTEDVALUE(KPIs[New Values]) & " by Supplier"
